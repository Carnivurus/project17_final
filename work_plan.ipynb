    "## Stage 1: Define Project Objective\n",
    "- Analyze client needs and objectives, assess feasibility, and generate a plan with defined timelines and responsibilities.\n",
    "- Translate the objective into an analytical problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stage 2: Data Collection\n",
    "- Acquire and extract project-related data from the company and load it into our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stage 3: Preprocessing\n",
    "- Data cleaning (remove duplicates, handle null values, ensure data consistency).\n",
    "- Data transformation (Normalization, scaling, and/or creation of new variables).\n",
    "- Data splitting (Split data into training, validation, and test sets).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stage 4: Exploration and Analysis\n",
    "- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and relationships.\n",
    "- Feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stage 5: Modeling\n",
    "- Apply various ML models and optimize for the best AUC metric (Classification) using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stage 6: Model Deployment\n",
    "- Deploy the winning model to obtain prediction results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stage 7: Results Presentation\n",
    "- Summarize project outcomes and present the learning curve derived from the project.\n"
